## Operating Systems

Recommended to start with minimal Linux or FreeBSD system. If possible,
an older laptop or desktop system will be better. Dual booting using
an external hard drive or USB stick will also work, if you only have one
computer and are not allowed to or worried about initially modifying and
breaking your exisiting operating system.
